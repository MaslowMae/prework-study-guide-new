        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We use HTML to build a sturdy frame, using HTML elements as our frames building blocks</li>
            <li>The DOCTYPE html is a declaration that tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened</li>
            <li>The opening tag is HTML which represents the root or start of the document</li>
            <li>The lang attribute is found inside the opening tag which tells the browser the language for the page.</li>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage such as metadata to render the page correcly and the title of the page for SEO</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user for them to also interact with</li>
            <Li>The section element is inside the body to provide organized thematic content</Li>
            <li>The header element is at the top of the body and can contain navigation links or menus</li>
            <li>The footer element is at the bottom of the page and usually contains author, copyright, contacts, or sitemap</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We use CSS to style of presentation for users, such as margins, colors, visuals, layout, and organization </li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred for separation of concerns</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused with margin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>The CSS box model: every HTML element is essentially a box and consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content</li>
          <li>(DRY) Do Not Repeat Yourself : Coding principle to reuse or share pieces of code to reduce the number of lines and overall size</li>
          <li>To link our css file that is in the same location as a seperate file we need to use the HTML link element</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Git allows us to work locally and change our work via branching in a way that doesn't conflict with collaborators </li>
       <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
       <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch</li>
       <li>stage changes when done with git add -A</li>
       <li>commit the changes with git commit -m "added blank"</li>
       <li>git init: initiallizes an existing directory as a git repository</li>
       <li>when in the correct directory in the terminal, type code . to open visual studio code workspace</li>
       <li>an SSH key is an access credential for the secure shell network protocol and allow for access without repeated password input</li>
       <li>it is important to properly create and share your ssh keys to allow developers to interface with remote services like git</li>
       <ls>the ssh keys are generated and then added to the ssh agent which keeps track of keys and passphrases</ls>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
          <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more</li>
          <li>JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:A variable is a named reference to a value</li>
          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code. Developers use it daily to debug and test the code that they write</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all</li>
